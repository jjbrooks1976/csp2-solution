# Client-side prediction and server reconciliation, part 2
(Forked from Joe Best-Rotheray's project, https://github.com/spectre1989/unity_physics_csp)

This is the solution for assignment 2. In this exercise, we extended the solution for assignment 1. More specifically, we implemented a client, server, and network layer. This includes establishing a connection between the client and server, sending input(s) at each tick, and responding to state updates.
