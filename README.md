# Client-side prediction and server reconciliation, part 2
(Forked from Joe Best-Rotheray's project, https://github.com/spectre1989/unity_physics_csp)

This is the base project for assignment 2. In this exercise, we'll extend the solution for assignment 1. More specifically, we'll implement a client, server, and network layer. This includes establishing a connection between the client and server, sending input(s) at each tick, and responding to state updates. Please review the source code and complete each TODO.
